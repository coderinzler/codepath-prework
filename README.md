##App Idea: Freelance Selection Application based on assesments
I thought how to improve and ensure quality of any project made by a 
freelance agent. Considering the type of project, responsibilities and 
requirements of the freelance profile. I propose a ranking system that 
measure each candidate's abilities, that lets a client post any job and a 
deadline. The candidate should post an assesment provided by him/her self 
so then any candidate could see it and apply to it. This activity is only 
focused on projects that enroll difficult requirements.
